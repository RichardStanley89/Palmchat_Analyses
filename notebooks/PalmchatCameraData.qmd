## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
Behavior_data <- read.csv("../rawdata/AggregatedEventsGrouped.csv")

Camera_data <- read.csv("../rawdata/FoscamCameraScheduleCodedNew.csv")
```

```{r}
joined_data <- left_join(Behavior_data, Camera_data, by = "Observation.id")
```

```{r}
Attributes <- read.csv("PalmchatBandingDataAll.csv")
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
